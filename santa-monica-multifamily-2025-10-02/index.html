                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p>The Santa Monica multifamily market in 2025 presents a complex but opportunity-rich landscape for investors. The market is characterized by a slowdown in transaction velocity, particularly for high-value properties, largely due to the impact of Measure GS. However, rental demand remains robust, and the city's strong economic fundamentals and desirable location continue to support premium valuations. The future outlook suggests a stabilizing market, with new construction expected to meet rental demand and a potential for increased investment activity as interest rates ease. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the current market conditions, rental trends, the impact of recent policy changes, and the future outlook for the Santa Monica multifamily sector.</p>

            <h2>Current Market Conditions</h2>
            <p>The Santa Monica multifamily market has experienced a significant slowdown in sales activity in 2025, particularly in the high-end segment. This is largely attributed to the implementation of Measure GS, which introduced a substantial transfer tax on properties sold for $8 million or more. As a result, transaction volume has decreased, and properties are taking longer to sell. However, the market for smaller and mid-size properties remains relatively active, with a clear demand for assets in the $2.3M to $3.6M range.</p>

            <h2>Rental Market Analysis</h2>
            <p>The rental market in Santa Monica remains strong, with a median rent of $2,476 per month, which is 11.6% higher than the Los Angeles metro area median. While rent growth has been relatively flat in recent months, the year-over-year growth stands at +1.6%. The vacancy rate is a healthy 4.7%, down 1.3% from the previous year. The rental market is currently in its slow season, and rents are expected to remain stable or see a slight decline in the coming months.</p>

            <h2>Impact of Measure GS</h2>
            <p>Measure GS, which took effect on March 1, 2023, has had a profound impact on the Santa Monica multifamily market, particularly for properties valued at $8 million and above. The 5.6% transfer tax has led to a significant decrease in sales volume and a 33% drop in the median price per square foot for these high-value properties. The total market activity for properties over $8M has declined by nearly 80% since the measure was implemented.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                The data is clear: Sales slowed sharply after Measure GS took effect. Prices per square foot dropped. Total market volume collapsed. Properties are taking longer to sell, and many months have seen zero closed transactions.

            <h2>Demographics and Housing Inventory</h2>
            <p>Santa Monica has a population of 92,357 as of 2020, with a significant portion of the population employed in professional and management roles. The housing stock is dominated by multifamily properties, with over 35,000 units in buildings with 5 or more units. This represents 78% of the total housing stock, highlighting the importance of the multifamily sector in the city's housing landscape.</p>

            <h2>Future Outlook and Trends</h2>
            <p>The future outlook for the Santa Monica multifamily market is one of stabilization and cautious optimism. The 650 new housing units currently under construction are expected to meet the growing rental demand upon their completion in 2026. The recent easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve is also expected to have a positive impact on the market, potentially leading to increased investment activity and a recovery in property values. However, a full pricing rebound is not expected until 2029 or beyond.</p>
            
            <h2>Investment Considerations</h2>
            <p>For investors, the Santa Monica multifamily market offers both challenges and opportunities. The high cost of entry and the impact of Measure GS require careful consideration. However, the strong rental demand, premium location, and potential for long-term appreciation make it an attractive market for those with a strategic approach. Investors should focus on value-add opportunities, particularly in neighborhoods like Ocean Park and Mid-City, where pricing per square foot is lower. The current market conditions also provide leverage for buyers to negotiate more favorable terms.</p>
